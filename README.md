## Prerequisites

1. You must be familiar with HTML/CSS, PHP, WordPress (including the use of the WordPress admin panel).
2. Proficiency with using theme/design frameworks (such as Elementor) will be additionally helpful.
3. Familiarity with custom plugin/theme development would be an added bonus.

## Getting Started

You would have to have a local WordPress development setup in place, with the following components (at least):

1. Web server (e.g, Apache)
2. DB server (e.g. MySQL)
3. PHP 7.4 or better
4. IDE/Editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

We recommend Laragon as a one-stop solution to get started with a local development environment (on Windows): [https://laragon.org/](https://laragon.org/)

## Problem Statement

You have to design the landing page for a corporate website using WordPress. A visual design of the landing page has been provided in the `mockups` folder. Download the mockups here: [GitHub](https://github.com/RenderbitTechnologies/WordPress-Developer-Exercise/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

All the text and images on the website should be fully editable from the WordPress admin panel. We recommend that you use Custom Post Types in WordPress to implement some of the home page functionality (such as portfolio items). You can implement CPTs using a custom theme/plugin, or using an existing third-party plugin such as CPT UI: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/)

Note that the first section of the website is a full-width slider with 3 slides:

The slider images and content should be editable from the WordPress admin panel.

The header nav menu bar is shown as an overlay on top of the full-width slider for the first section. The header position then remains fixed at the top for all the other sections. The header nav menu should be editable from the WordPress admin panel.
